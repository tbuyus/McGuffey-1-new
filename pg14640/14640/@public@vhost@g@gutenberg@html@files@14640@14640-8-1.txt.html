<p id="id00594" style="margin-top: 2em">[Illustration: Hen and chicks.]</p>

<p id="id00595" style="margin-top: 2em">There was once a big, white hen that had twelve little chickens. They were
very small, and the old hen took good care of them. She found food for
them in the daytime, and at night kept them under her wings.</p>

<p id="id00596">One day, this old hen took her chickens down to a small brook. She thought
the air from the water would do them good.</p>

<p id="id00597">When they got to the brook, they walked on the bank a little while. It was
very pretty on the other side of the brook, and the old hen thought she
would take her children over there.</p>

<p id="id00598">There was a large stone in the brook: she thought it would be easy for
them to jump to that stone, and from it to the other side.</p>

<p id="id00599">So she jumped to the stone, and told the children to come after her. For
the first time, she found that they would not obey her.</p>

<p id="id00600">She flapped her wings, and cried, "Come here, all of you! Jump upon this
stone, as I did. We can then jump to the other side. Come now!"</p>

<p id="id00601">"O mother! we can't, we can't, we can't!" said all the little chickens.</p>

<p id="id00602">"Yes you can, if you try," said the old hen. "Just flap your wings, as I
did, and you can jump over."</p>

<p id="id00603">"I am flapping my wings," said Chippy, who stood by himself; "but I can't
jump any better than I could before."</p>

<p id="id00607" style="margin-top: 2em">[Illustration: Hen with chicks.]</p>

<p id="id00608" style="margin-top: 2em">"I never saw such children," said the old hen. "You don't try at all."</p>

<p id="id00609">"We can't jump so far, mother. Indeed we can't, we can't!" chirped the
little chickens.</p>

<p id="id00610">"Well," said the old hen, "I must give it up." So she jumped back to the
bank, and walked slowly home with her brood.</p>

<p id="id00611">"I think mother asked too much of us," said one little chicken to the
others.</p>

<p id="id00612">"Well, I tried," said Chippy.</p>

<p id="id00613">"We didn't," said the others; "it was of no use to try."</p>

<p id="id00614">When they got home, the old hen began to look about for something to eat.<br/>

She soon found, near the back door, a piece of bread.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00615">So she called the chickens, and they all ran up to her, each one trying to
get a bite at the piece of bread.</p>

<p id="id00616">"No, no!" said the old hen. "This bread is for Chippy. He is the only one
of my children that really tried to jump to the stone."</p>

electronic works</h4>

<p id="id00650">1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p id="id00651">1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p id="id00652">1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

copied or distributed:</p>

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p id="id00670">1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<h4 id="id00676" style="margin-top: 2em">Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h4>

<p id="id00677">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p id="id00678">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h4 id="id00683" style="margin-top: 2em">Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h4>

<p id="id00684">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p id="id00685">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org</p>

<p id="id00686">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p id="id00687">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

works.</h4>

<p id="id00690">Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p id="id00691" style="margin-top: 2em">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p id="id00692" style="margin-top: 2em">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:</p>

</p>

<p id="id00694">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
