<p id="id00009" class="picpara" >Welcome to the s<tt>ch</tt>oolroom of 1900. The moral tone is plain. "She is kind
to the old blind man."</p>

<p id="id00010" class="picpara" >The exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful than some contemporary alternatives. Much is left to the teacher. Explanations given in the text are enough to get started teaching a child to read and write.  Counting in Roman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson numbers.</p>

<p id="id00011" class="picpara" >Each lesson begins with vocabulary words, followed by the description of a picture (if any) related to the lesson's reading exercise. The lesson then consists of printed text for reading and sometimes script (handwriting) for reading or copying.</p>

<h5 id="id00020">SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.</h5>

<p id="id00021" class="picpara" >This First Reader may be used in teaching reading by any of the methods in common use; but it is especially adapted to the Phonic Method, the Word Method, or a combination of the two.</p>

<p id="id00022" class="picpara" >I. Phonic Method.—First teach the elementary sounds and their representative, the letters marked with diacriticals, as they occur in the lessons; then, the formation of words by the combination of these sounds.  For instance, teach the pupil to identify the characters a, o, n, d, g, r, and th, in Lesson I, as the representatives of certain elementary sounds; then teach him to form the words at the head of the lesson, then other words, as nag, on, and, etc. Pursue a similar course in teaching the succeeding lessons. Having read a few lessons in this manner, begin to teach the names of the letters and the spelling of words, and require the groups, "a man," "the man," "a pen," to be read as a good reader would pronounce single words.</p>

<p id="id00023" class="picpara" >II.  When one of the letters in the combinations ou or ow, is marked in the words at the head of the reading exercises, the other is silent. If neither is marked, the two letters represent a diphthong. All other unmarked vowels in the vocabularies, when in combination, are silent letters. In slate or blackboard work, the silent letters may be canceled.</p> 
<p id="id00024" class="picpara" >III. Word Method.—Teach the pupil to identify at sight the words placed at the head of the reading exercises, and to read these exercises without hesitation. Having read a few lessons, begin to teach the names of the letters and the spelling of words.</p> 
<p id="id00025" class="picpara" >IV. Word Method and Phonic Method Combined.—Teach the pupil to identify words and read sentences, as above. Having read a few lessons in this manner, begin to use the Phonic Method, combining it with the Word Method, by first teaching the words in each lesson as words; then the elementary sounds, the names of the letters, and spelling.</p>

<p id="id00026" class="picpara" >V. Teach the pupil to use script letters in writing, when teaching the names of the letters and the spelling of words.</p>

<p id="id00029" >Preface</p>

<p id="id00030" class="picpara" >In presenting McGuffeys Revised First Reader to the public, attention is invited to the following features:</p>

<p id="id00031" class="picpara" >1. Words of only two or three letters are used in the first lessons.  Longer and more difficult ones are gradually introduced as the pupil gains aptness in the mastery of words.</p>

<p id="id00032" class="picpara" >2. A proper gradation has been carefully preserved. All new words are placed at the head of each lesson, to be learned before the lesson is read. Their number in the early lessons is very small, thus making the first steps easy. All words in these vocabularies are used in the text immediately following.</p>

<p id="id00033" class="picpara" >3. Carefully engraved script exercises are introduced for a double purpose. These should be used to teach the reading of script; and may also serve as copies in slate work.</p>

<p id="id00034" class="picpara" >4. The illustrations have been designed and engraved specially for the lessons in which they occur. Many of the engravings will serve admirably as the basis for oral lessons in language.</p>

<p id="id00035" class="picpara" >5. The type is large, strong, and distinct.</p>

<p id="id00036" class="picpara" >The credit for this revision is almost wholly due to the  friends of McGuffeys Readers,—eminent teachers and scholars, who have contributed suggestions and criticisms gained from their daily work in the schoolroom.</p>

<p id="id00499">"No, it was the other one."</p>

<p id="id00500">"Do tell me how she got it, Frank. Did she run after it?"</p>

<p id="id00501">"No, that was not the way. Puss was hid on a big box. The rat stole out, and she jumped at it and caught it."</p>

<p id="id00502">"Poor rat! It must have been very hungry; it came out to get something to eat."</p>

<p id="id00503">"Why, Hattie, you are not sorry puss got the rat, are you?"</p>

<p id="id00504">"No, I can not say I am sorry she got it; but I do not like to see even a rat suffer pain."</p>

<p id="id00509" >Mary and Lucy have come down to the beach with their grandpa. They live in a town near the sea.</p>

<p id="id00510">Their grandpa likes to sit on the large rock, and watch the big ships as they sail far away on the blue sea. Sometimes he sits there all day long.</p>

<p id="id00511">The little girls like to dig in the sand, and pick up pretty shells. They watch the waves as they roll up on the beach, and break into white foam.</p>

<p id="id00512">They sometimes make little houses of sand, and build walls around them; and they dig wells with their small wooden spades.</p>

<p id="id00513">They have been picking up shells for their little sister. She is too young to come to the beach.</p>

<p id="id00514">I think all children like to play by the seaside when the sun is bright, and the wind does not blow too hard.</p>

<p id="id00519" >One day, Willie's father saw a boy at the market with four little white rabbits in a basket.</p>

<p id="id00520">He thought these would be nice pets for Willie; so he asked the lad how much he wanted for his rabbits.</p>

<p id="id00521">The boy said, "Only fifty cents, sir."</p>

<p id="id00522">Willie's father bought them, and carried them home.</p>

<p id="id00523">Here you see the rabbits and their little master. He has a pen for them, and always shuts them in it at night to keep them safe.</p>

<p id="id00524">He gives them bread and grass to eat. They like grass, and will take it from his hand. He has called in a little friend to see them.</p>

<p id="id00525">Willie is telling him about their funny ways.</p>

<p id="id00535">"What would the old bird do, Rose, if she should come back and not find her nest?"</p>

<p id="id00536">"Oh, we would bring it right back, Willie!"</p>

<p id="id00537">"Yes; but we could not fasten it in its place again. If the wind should blow it over, the eggs would get broken."</p>

<p id="id00542">"The mother bird has her bill and her claws to work with, but she would not know how to make the nest if God did not teach her. Do you see what it is made of?"</p>

<p id="id00543">"Yes, Willie, I see some horse-hairs and some dry grass. The old bird must have worked hard to find all the hairs, and make them into such a pretty, round nest."</p>

<p id="id00544">"Shall we take the nest, Rose?"</p>

<p id="id00545">"Oh no, Willie! We must not take it; but we will come and look at it again, some time."</p>

<p id="id00554">"Where did it go, Rose?"</p>

<p id="id00555">"I don't know; away off, somewhere."</p>

<p id="id00556">"I can guess where, Rose. Don't you know the nest we saw some days ago?</p>
<p> What do you think is in it now?"</p>

<p id="id00557">"O Willie, I know! Some little brown birds. Let us go and see them."</p>

<p id="id00558">"All right; but we must not go too near. There! I just saw the old bird fly out of the bush. Stand here, Rose. Can you see?"</p>

<p id="id00559">"Why, Willie, what ugly little things! What big mouths they have, and no feathers!"</p>

<p id="id00560">"Keep still, Rose. Here comes the old bird with a worm in her bill. How hard she must work to feed them all!"</p>

<p id="id00572" >One day, when Mary was taking a walk down the lane, trying to sing her doll to sleep, she met Frank, with his basket and cane.</p>

<p id="id00573">Frank was a poor, little, lame boy. His father and mother were dead. His dear, old grandma took care of him, and tried to make him happy.</p>

<p id="id00574">Every day, Mary's mother filled Frank's basket with bread and meat, and a little tea for his grandma.</p>

<p id="id00575">"How do you do, Frank?" said Mary. "Don't make a noise; my doll is going to sleep. It is just a little sick to-day."</p>

<p id="id00576">"Well, then, let us whistle it to sleep." And Frank, taking a willow whistle out of his pocket, blew a long note.</p>

<p id="id00577">"Oh, how sweet!" cried Mary. "Do let me try."</p>

<p id="id00582" >"Yes, Mary, I will give it to you, because you are so good to my grandma."</p>

<p id="id00583">"Oh! thank you very much." Mary blew and blew a long time. "I can't make it whistle," said she, almost ready to cry.</p>

<p id="id00584">"Sometimes they will whistle, and sometimes they won't," said Frank. "Try again, Mary."</p>

<p id="id00585">She tried once more, and the whistle made a low, sweet sound. "It whistles!" she cried.</p>

<p id="id00586">In her joy, she had turned the doll's face down, and its eyes shut tight, as if it had gone to sleep.</p>

<p id="id00587">"There!" cried Frank, "I told you the way to put a doll to sleep, is to whistle to it."</p>

<p id="id00588">"So it is," said Mary. "Dear, little thing; it must be put in its bed now."</p>

<p id="id00589">So they went into the house. Frank's basket was soon filled, and he went home happy.</p>
